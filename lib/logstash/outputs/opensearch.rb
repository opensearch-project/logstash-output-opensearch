# This plugin is the recommended method of storing logs in OpenSearch.
# If you plan on using the OpenSearch Dashboards web interface, you'll want to use this output.
#
# This output only speaks the HTTP protocol. HTTP is the preferred protocol for interacting with OpenSearch.
# We strongly encourage the use of HTTP over the node protocol for a number of reasons. HTTP is only marginally slower,
# yet far easier to administer and work with. When using the HTTP protocol one may upgrade OpenSearch versions without having
# to upgrade Logstash in lock-step.
#
# You can learn more about OpenSearch at <https://opensearch.org/>
#
# ==== Retry Policy
# This plugin uses the OpenSearch bulk API to optimize its imports into OpenSearch. These requests may experience
# either partial or total failures.
#
# The following errors are retried infinitely:
#
# - Network errors (inability to connect)
# - 429 (Too many requests) and
# - 503 (Service unavailable) errors
#
# NOTE: 409 exceptions are no longer retried. Please set a higher `retry_on_conflict` value if you experience 409 exceptions.
# It is more performant for OpenSearch to retry these exceptions than this plugin.
#
# ==== Batch Sizes ====
# This plugin attempts to send batches of events as a single request. However, if
# a request exceeds 20MB we will break it up until multiple batch requests. If a single document exceeds 20MB it will be sent as a single request.
#
# ==== DNS Caching
#
# This plugin uses the JVM to lookup DNS entries and is subject to the value of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[networkaddress.cache.ttl],
# a global setting for the JVM.
#
# As an example, to set your DNS TTL to 1 second you would set
# the `LS_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to `-Dnetworkaddress.cache.ttl=1`.
#
# Keep in mind that a connection with keepalive enabled will
# not reevaluate its DNS value while the keepalive is in effect.
#
# ==== HTTP Compression
#
# This plugin supports request and response compression. Response compression is enabled by default,
# the user doesn't have to set any configs in OpenSearch for it to send back compressed response.
#
# For requests compression, users have to enable `http_compression`
# setting in their Logstash config file.

  # - index: indexes a document (an event from Logstash).
  # - delete: deletes a document by id (An id is required for this action)
  # - create: indexes a document, fails if a document by that id already exists in the index.
  # - update: updates a document by id. Update has a special case where you can upsert -- update a
  #   document if not already present. See the `upsert` option.
  # - A sprintf style string to change the action based on the content of the event. The value `%{[foo]}`
  #   would use the foo field for the action
  #
  # For more details on actions, check out the https://opensearch.org/docs/opensearch/rest-api/document-apis/bulk/[OpenSearch bulk API documentation]
  config :action, :validate => :string, :default => "index"

  # The index to write events to. This can be dynamic using the `%{foo}` syntax.
  # The default value will partition your indices by day so you can more easily
  # delete old data or only search specific date ranges.
  # Indexes may not contain uppercase characters.
  # For weekly indexes ISO 8601 format is recommended, eg. logstash-%{+xxxx.ww}.
  # LS uses Joda to format the index pattern from event timestamp.

  # From Logstash 1.3 onwards, a template is applied to OpenSearch during
  # Logstash's startup if one with the name `template_name` does not already exist.
  # By default, the contents of this template is the default template for
  # `logstash-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}` which always matches indices based on the pattern
  # `logstash-*`.  Should you require support for other index names, or would like
  # to change the mappings in the template in general, a custom template can be
  # specified by setting `template` to the path of a template file.
  #
  # Setting `manage_template` to false disables this feature.  If you require more
  # control over template creation, (e.g. creating indices dynamically based on
  # field names) you should set `manage_template` to false and use the REST
  # API to apply your templates manually.
  config :manage_template, :validate => :boolean, :default => true

  # This configuration option defines how the template is named inside OpenSearch.
  # Note that if you have used the template management features and subsequently
  # change this, you will need to prune the old template manually, e.g.
  #
  # `curl -XDELETE <http://localhost:9200/_template/OldTemplateName?pretty>`

  # in OpenSearch with either the one indicated by template or the included one.
  # This option is set to false by default. If you always want to stay up to date
  # with the template provided by Logstash, this option could be very useful to you.
  # Likewise, if you have your own template file managed by puppet, for example, and
  # you wanted to be able to update it regularly, this option could help there as well.
  #
  # Please note that if you are using your own customized version of the Logstash
  # template (logstash), setting this to true will make Logstash to overwrite
  # the "logstash" template (i.e. removing all customized settings)
