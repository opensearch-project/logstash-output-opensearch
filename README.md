**logstash-output-opensearch** is a community-driven, open source fork logstash-output-elasticsearch licensed under the [Apache v2.0 License](LICENSE). For more information, see [opensearch.org](https://opensearch.org/).

The logstash-output-opensearch plugin helps to ship events from Logstash to OpenSearch cluster.

## Configuration for Logstash Output Opensearch Plugin

To run the Logstash Output Opensearch plugin, add following configuration in your logstash.conf file.
```
output {
    opensearch {
        hosts       => ["hostname:port"]
        user        => "admin"
        password    => "admin"
        index       => "logstash-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    }
}
```

To run the Logstash Output Opensearch plugin using aws_iam authentication, refer to the sample configuration shown below:
```
output {        
   opensearch {     
          hosts => ["hostname:port"]              
          auth_type => {    
              type => 'aws_iam'     
              aws_access_key_id => 'ACCESS_KEY'     
              aws_secret_access_key => 'SECRET_KEY'     
              region => 'us-west-2'         
          }         
          index  => "logstash-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"      
   }            
}
```

In addition to the existing authentication mechanisms, if we want to add new authentication then we will be adding them in the configuration by using auth_type.

Example Configuration for basic authentication:
```
output {    
    opensearch {        
          hosts  => ["hostname:port"]     
          auth_type => {            
              type => 'basic'           
              user => 'admin'           
              password => 'admin'           
          }             
          index => "logstash-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"       
   }            
}  
```

To ingest data into a `data stream` through logstash, we need to create the data stream and specify the name of data stream and the `op_type` of `create` in the output configuration. The sample configuration is shown below:

```yml
output {    
    opensearch {        
          hosts  => ["https://hostname:port"]     
          auth_type => {            
              type => 'basic'           
              user => 'admin'           
              password => 'admin'           
          }
          index => "my-data-stream"
          action => "create"
   }            
}               
```
## ECS Compatibility
[Elastic Common Schema(ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html]) compatibility for V8 was added in 1.3.0. For more details on ECS support refer to this [documentation](docs/ecs_compatibility.md).
